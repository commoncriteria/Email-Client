    <section title="Compliant Targets of Evaluation" id="TOEdescription"> This document provides an
      extended set of Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) for an email client, which is the
      Target of Evaluation (TOE). The terms email client and TOE are interchangeable in this
      document.<br/> The Protection Profile for Application Software (App PP) defines the baseline
      SFRs for application software which runs on mobile devices ("apps"), as well as on desktop and
      server platforms. This Extended Package (EP) for email clients is not complete in itself, but
      rather extends the baseline of App PP. <br/> Email clients are applications used to send,
      receive, access and manage email provided by an email server. The complexity of email content
      and email clients has grown over time. Modern email clients can render HTML as well as
      plaintext, and may include functionality to display common attachment formats, such as Adobe
      PDF and Microsoft Word documents. Some email clients allow their functionality to be modified
      by users through the addition of add-ons. This complex and rich feature set makes email
      clients a target for attackers. Protocols have also been defined for communicating between
      email clients and servers. Some clients support multiple protocols for doing the same task,
      allowing them to be configured according to email server specifications. </section>

        <description> The Protection Profile for Application Software (App PP) defines the baseline
          Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) and Security Assurance Requirements (SARs) for
          application software products. This EP serves to extend the App PP baseline with
          additional SFRs and associated Assurance Activities specific to an email client. Assurance
          Activities are the actions that the evaluator performs in order to determine an email
          client’s compliance to the SFRs.<br/> This EP conforms to Common Criteria <cite
            linkend="bibCC"/> for Information Technology Security Evaluation, Version 3.1, Revision
          4. It is CC Part 2 extended and CC Part 3 conformant. In order to be conformant to this
          EP, the ST must include all components in this EP and the associated App PP that are:
              <ul><li>unconditional (which are always required)</li>
            <li>selection-based (which are required when certain selections are chosen in the
              unconditional requirements)</li>

  <chapter title="Security Problem Description" id="spd"> The security problem is described in terms
    of the threats that the email client is expected to address, assumptions about the operational
    environment, and any organizational security policies that it is expected to enforce. <br/> This
    Extended Package does not repeat the threats, assumptions, and organizational security policies
    identified in the App PP, though they all apply given the conformance and hence dependence of
    this EP on it. Together the threats, assumptions and organizational security policies of the App
    PP and those defined in this EP describe those addressed by an email client as the Target of
    Evaluation. <br/> Notably, email clients are particularly at risk from the Network Attack threat
    identified in the App PP. Attackers can send malicious email messages directly to users, and the
    email client will render or otherwise process this untrusted content.<br/>Threats are extended
    from the <cite linkend="bibAppPP"/> and include an additional threat that is specific to email
    clients. <section title="Threats" id="threats">
      <!-- The following threat is specific to email clients and represents an addition to

          <description> Email client functionality can be extended with integration of third-party
            utilities and tools. This expanded set of capabilities is made possible via the use of
            add-ons. The tight integration between the basic email client code and the new
            capabilities that add-ons provide increases the risk that malefactors could inject
            serious flaws into the email client application, either maliciously by an attacker, or
            accidentally by a developer. These flaws enable undesirable behaviors including, but not
            limited to, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information in the email client,
            unauthorized access to the device's file system, or even privilege escalation that
            enables unauthorized access to other applications or the operating system.

  <appendix title="Optional Requirements" id="optional"> As indicated in <secref linkend="ccl"/>,
    the baseline requirements (those that must be performed by the <abbr linkend="TOE"/>) are
    contained in the body of this EP. Additionally, there are three other types of requirements
    specified in <appref linkend="optional"/>, <appref linkend="sel-based"/>, and <appref
      linkend="objective"/>. The first type (in this Appendix) are requirements that can be included
    in the <abbr linkend="ST"/>, but are not required in order for an email client to claim
    conformance to this EP. The second type (in <appref linkend="sel-based"/>) are requirements
    based on selections in the body of the EP: if certain selections are made, then additional
    requirements in that appendix must be included. The third type (in <appref linkend="objective"/>
    are components that are not required in order to conform to this EP, but will be included in the
    baseline requirements in future versions of this EP, so adoption by vendors is encouraged. Note
    that the ST author is responsible for ensuring that requirements that may be associated with
    those in <appref linkend="optional"/>, <appref linkend="sel-based"/>, and <appref
      linkend="objective"/> but are not listed (e.g., FMT-type requirements) are also included in
    the ST. </appendix>
  <appendix title="Selection-Based Requirements" id="sel-based">As indicated in the introduction to
    this EP, the baseline requirements (those that must be performed by the email client or its
    underlying platform) are contained in the App PP and in the body of this EP. There are
    additional requirements based on selections from the App PP and/or in the body of the EP: if
    certain selections are made, then additional requirements below will need to be included. </appendix>
  <appendix title="Objective Requirements" id="objective"> This Annex includes requirements that
    specify security functionality which also addresses threats. The requirements are not currently
    mandated in the body of this EP as they describe security functionality not yet widely-available
    in commercial technology. However, these requirements may be included in the ST such that the
    email client is still conformant to this EP, and it is expected that they be included as soon as
    possible. </appendix>
