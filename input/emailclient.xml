    <section title="Compliant Targets of Evaluation" id="TOEdescription"> This document provides an
      extended set of Security Functional Requirements (SFRs) for an Email client, which is the
      Target of Evaluation (TOE). <br/> The Protection Profile for Application Software defines the
      baseline SFRs for application software which runs on mobile devices ("apps"), as well as on
      desktop and server platforms. This Extended Package (EP) for email clients is not complete in
      itself, but rather extends the baseline of Protection Profile for Application Software. <br/>
      Email clients are applications used to send, receive, access and manage email provided by an
      email server. The complexity of email content and email clients has grown over time. Modern
      email clients can render HTML as well as plaintext, and may include functionality to display
      common attachment formats, such as Adobe PDF and Microsoft Word documents. Some email clients
      allow their functionality to be modified by users through the addition of extensions or
      plug-ins. Protocols have also been defined for communicating between email clients and
      servers. Some clients support multiple protocols for doing the same task, allowing them to be
      configured according to email server specifications. <br/> The complexity and rich feature set
      of modern email clients make them a target for attackers, introducing security concerns. This
      EP along with the associated PP are intended to facilitate the improvement of email client
      security by requiring use of operating system security services, cryptographic standards, and
      environmental mitigations. Additionally, the requirements in this document define acceptable
      behavior for email clients regardless of the security features provided by the operating
      system. <br/> The requirements apply to all email clients that run on any operating system,
      regardless of the composition of the underlying platform. For purposes of this EP, an
      application is defined as software that runs on an operating system and performs tasks on
      behalf of the user or owner of the platform. An email client is an application that retrieves
      and manages email provided by an email server. Extensions and plug-ins are code packages that
      can be loaded by the email client to introduce new or specialized functionality to the client. </section>
    <section title="Use Cases" id="usecases">Email clients perform tasks associated primarily with
      the following use case. <usecases>
        <usecase title="Sending, receiving, accessing, managing and displaying email">
          <description>Email clients are used for sending, receiving, viewing, accessing, managing
            email in coordination with a mail server. Email clients can render HTML as well as
            plaintext, and can display common attachment formats. </description>

      <threats>
        <threat id="T.UNAUTHORIZED_UPDATE">
          <description> Malicious or Flawed Updates: Since the most common attack vector used
            involves attacking unpatched versions of software containing well-known flaws, updating
            the email client is necessary to ensure that changes to threat environment are
            addressed. Timely application of patches ensures that the client is a “hard target”,
            thus increasing the likelihood that product will be able to maintain and enforce its
            security policy. However, the updates to be applied to the product must be trustable in
            some manner; otherwise, an attacker can write their own “update” that instead contains
            malicious code of their choosing, such as a rootkit, bot, or other malware. Once this
            “update” is installed, the attacker then has control of the system and all of its data.
          </description>
        </threat>
        <threat id="T.UNAUTHORIZED_ADDON">
          <description> Malicious or Flawed Plug-ins or Extensions: Email client functionality can
            be extended with integration of third-party utilities and tools. This expanded set of
            capabilities is made possible via the use of plug-ins and extensions. The tight
            integration between the basic email client code and the new capabilities that plug-ins
            and extensions provide increases the risk that malefactors could inject serious flaws
            into the email client application, either maliciously by an attacker, or accidentally by
            a developer. These flaws enable undesirable behaviors including, but not limited to,
            allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information in the email client, unauthorized
            access to the device‟s file system, or even privilege escalation that enables
            unauthorized access to other applications or the operating system. </description>
        </threat>
        <threat id="T.NETWORK_EAVESDROP">
          <description> Network Eavesdropping: Network eavesdropping involves an attacker
            positioning himself on the network in order to monitor transmissions between a system
            and the intended destination of some potentially sensitive data. With respect to email
            clients, this entails monitoring the transactions between the email client and the MUA
            and MTA. </description>
        </threat>
        <threat id="T.NETWORK_ATTACK">
          <description>Network Attack: Network attack is similar to network eavesdropping in that it
            entails an attacker positioning herself on the network. It differs from network
            eavesdropping in that it involves the attacker engaging in communications with a system,
            or modifying data between a system and some data‟s legitimate destination. With respect
            to email clients, network attack might involve sending malicious data to the email
            client in order to exploit vulnerabilities that may influence its behavior, or modifying
            account information en route to a MUA or MTA. Email client attacks generally occur on
            Internet connected email client, but are not unknown to occur within closed networks.
            One class of attack that may exploit vulnerabilities in the email client software or
            email client extensions involves the use of phishing or other social engineering
            technique to deliver the exploit. In this kind of attack, a user opens a malicious
            attachment or clicks on a link to a malicious website, which then executes the exploit
            that compromises the email client, often with no indication to the user.</description>

  <chapter title="Security Requirements" id="req">This chapter describes the security requirements
    which have to be fulfilled by the <abbr linkend="TOE"/>. Those requirements comprise functional
    components from Part 2 of <cite linkend="bibCC"/>. The following notations are used: <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Refinement</b> operation (denoted by <b>bold text</b>): is used to add details to a
        requirement, and thus further restricts a requirement.</li>
      <li>
        <b>Selection</b> (denoted by <i>italicized text</i>): is used to select one or more options
        provided by the [CC] in stating a requirement.</li>
      <li>
        <b>Assignment</b> operation (denoted by <i>italicized text</i>): is used to assign a
        specific value to an unspecified parameter, such as the length of a password. Showing the
        value in square brackets indicates assignment.</li>
      <li>
        <b>Iteration</b> operation: are identified with a number inside parentheses (e.g.
        "(1)")</li>

              (S/MIME) to sign, verify, encrypt, and decrypt mail.</title>
            <note role="application">S/MIME is used to sign messages at the request of the user
              (FMT_SMF.1.1 Function 7) upon sending email via the Mail Transfer Agent. S/MIME is
              used by a recipient to verify the digital signature on a signed message upon receipt
              or viewing of the message. Encryption of messages occurs at the request of the user
              (FMT_SMF.1.1 Function 8) upon sending email via the Mail Transfer Agent, and
              decryption of emails occurs upon receipt or viewing of the message. Note that this
              requirement does not mandate that S/MIME be used for all incoming/outgoing messages,
              or that the TOE automatically encrypt and/or sign/verify all sent or received
              messages. This requirement only specifies that the mechanism for digital signature and
              encryption must be S/MIME.</note>
            <aactivity>The evaluator shall verify that the TSS contains a description of the S/MIME
              implementation and its use to protect mail from undetected modification using digital
              signatures and unauthorized disclosure using encryption. The evaluator shall verify
              that the TSS describes whether signature verification and decryption occur at receipt
              or viewing of the message contents, and whether messages are stored with their S/MIME
              envelopes.<br/> The evaluator shall ensure that the AGD guidance includes instructions
              for configuring a certificate for S/MIME use and instructions for signing and
              encrypting email.<br/> Tests for this element are performed in conjunction with tests

              either by the TOE or TOE platform according to FMT_SMF.1.1 Function 10.</note>

              repository is local, remote, or both, and whether the repository is managed by the TOE
              or by the platform. If the description indicates that a remote repository may be used,
              the evaluator shall ensure that the description indicates which protocols may be used
              for interfacing with that repository. The evaluator shall also verify that the
              description of the local repository indicates whether certificates are loaded
              automatically or must be added manually. If loaded automatically, the evaluator shall
              ensure that a description of the automatic mechanism is provided (for example, when
              signed emails are received the associated certificates are loaded into the local
              repository).<br/> The evaluator shall also verify that the AGD guidance contains
              instructions for configuring the certificate repository used for S/MIME encryption. If

                    by modifying the signature itself. The evaluator shall verify that the received

                    the encrypted traffic in an attempt to determine the ciphersuite and the proper
                    implementation. In addition, the evaluator shall use a man-in-the-middle tool to
                    modify at least one byte of the message such that the encryption is no longer
                    valid. The evaluator shall verify that the received message fails to decrypt. </test>
                  <test>The evaluator shall both send and receive a message that is both signed and
                    encrypted. It is not necessary to examine the encrypted traffic to meet the

                    man-in-the-middle tool to modify at least one byte of the message such that the
                    encryption and signature are no longer valid. The evaluator shall verify that

                the key agreement bit (for Diffie-Hellman encryption schemes) or the key
                encipherment bit (for RSA encryption schemes) be set. Certificates obtained for use
                by the TOE will have to conform to these requirements in order to be used in the

              executable). The TSS must include any error states that the TSF or TOE platform may
              enter when self-tests fail, and the conditions and actions necessary to exit the error
              states and resume normal operation. The evaluator shall verify that the TSS indicates
              these self-tests are run at start-up automatically, and do not involve any inputs from
              or actions by the user or operator.<br/>

  <appendix title="Optional Requirements" id="optional"> As indicated in <secref linkend="ccl"/>,
    the baseline requirements (those that must be performed by the <abbr linkend="TOE"/>) are
    contained in the body of this EP. Additionally, there are three other types of requirements
    specified in <appref linkend="optional"/>, <appref linkend="sel-based"/>, and <appref
      linkend="objective"/>. The first type (in this Appendix) are requirements that can be included
    in the <abbr linkend="ST"/>, but are not required in order for a TOE to claim conformance to
    this PP. The second type (in <appref linkend="sel-based"/>) are requirements based on selections
    in the body of the EP: if certain selections are made, then additional requirements in that
    appendix must be included. The third type (in <appref linkend="objective"/> are components that
    are not required in order to conform to this EP, but will be included in the baseline
    requirements in future versions of this EP, so adoption by vendors is encouraged. Note that the
    ST author is responsible for ensuring that requirements that may be associated with those in
      <appref linkend="optional"/>, <appref linkend="sel-based"/>, and <appref linkend="objective"/>
    but are not listed (e.g., FMT-type requirements) are also included in the ST. </appendix>

  <appendix title="Selection-Based Requirements" id="sel-based">As indicated in the introduction to
    this EP, the baseline requirements (those that must be performed by the TOE or its underlying
    platform) are contained in the Protection Profile for Application Software and in the body of
    this EP. There are additional requirements based on selections in the body of the EP: if certain
    selections are made, then additional requirements below will need to be included. </appendix>

  <appendix title="Objective Requirements" id="objective"> This Annex includes requirements that
    specify security functionality which also addresses threats. The requirements are not currently
    mandated in the body of this EP as they describe security functionality not yet widely-available
    in commercial technology. However, these requirements may be included in the ST such that the
    TOE is still conformant to this EP, and it is expected that they be included as soon as
    possible. </appendix>
